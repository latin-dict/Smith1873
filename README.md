## Data

This repository is a partial clone of [canonical-pdlrefwk](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-pdlrefwk).

File in TEI format was corrected in several places but also slightly adapted for the goals of dictionary compiling (nodes `<keys>` and `<k>` were added), so be careful on reusing this file, it does not fully correspond TEI standards.
